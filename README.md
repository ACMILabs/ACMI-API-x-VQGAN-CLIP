# ACMI API x VQGAN+CLIP

An example of what you can build with the [ACMI Public API](https://github.com/ACMILabs/acmi-api).

This code uses the ACMI Public API to return a random image from the first `50` Collection Works, and then passes on its metadata to `VQGAN+CLIP` to generate images and a video of each iteration step from that metadata.

Visit our API at: [api.acmi.net.au](https://api.acmi.net.au)

## Run it on Google Colab

The Jupyter Notebook code to run this on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) can be found in in the file `ACMI_Public_API_x_VQGAN+CLIP_(with_pooling).ipynb`.

Run it in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-notebook]

[colab-badge]: <https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg>

To generate images:

* Click `Connect` on the top right in Google Colab to have infrastructure allocated to you
* Click the `play` button on the top left of each step to run that step
* Wait for a step to complete with a green tick before clicking the next step
* **Note**: the image generation iterations take ~15 minutes to run

### Samples

Below are some pre-generated images and the metadata that they were generated from.

**Metadata**: `['Untitled Goose Game', 'Untitled Goose Game is a slapstick-stealth-sandbox, where you are a goose let loose on an unsuspecting village.

As we watch the old woman dying her daughter confronts the finality of death; the bitterness of memory. Shot entirely in a studio ‚ÄúNight cries‚Äù uses a stark set-design, a palette of colours as from a dream, and a haunting soundtrack of bush noises, gasping breath, the wail of a dingo, to suggest a world that combines the frightening distortion of a nightmare and the painful isolation of human loss. Subtitled ‚Äúa rural tragedy‚Äù the film‚Äôs portrayal of a personal agony illuminates and exposes the general horror of Australia‚Äôs race history. With Marcia Langton, Agnes Hardwick and Jimmy Little']`
